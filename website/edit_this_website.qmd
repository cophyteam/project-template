To modify this website you'll have to:

1. Join the [cophyteam](https://github.com/cophyteam) organisation on Github. If you have not already been added, please share your Github account in the dedicated channel on Cophy Mattermost (i.e. ⚒️ Git - Github).

2. Still on Mattermost, ask Mathilde or Romain to add you as a collaborator to the [project-template](https://github.com/cophyteam/project-template) repository.

3. Log into Github and make sure your command line is connected to (see the [Github help](/help_github.html) if needed)

4. Clone the [project-template](https://github.com/cophyteam/project-template) repository.

5. Make the change you want to do in the `website` folder. 

::: {.alert .alert-dismissible .alert-warning} 
Please only edit the .qmd files within the `website` folder and the website->navbar area of the file .website/_quarto.yml (only needed if you want to add a new .qmd web page). 
In principle, you should not need to do other changes. You may play with the .scss file if you know what you are doing.
:::

6. Add, commit and push to the main branch. This should automatically trigger and update of the [website](https://cophyteam.github.io/project-template) after a few minutes (you can check the deployment process [here](https://github.com/cophyteam/project-template/actions))


Simple, isn't it? ::bulb::
